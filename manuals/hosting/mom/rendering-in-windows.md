This document discusses how to render a Manuscript with the support of Windows. ASNA provides two different implementations of a Report Renderer:
 + [DataGate Renderer](#datagate-renderer)
 + [Open.Renderer](#openrenderer)

## Common Features of the Two Implementations

ASNA's Print File Renderer (**Renderer.exe**) is called automatically when you close a print file (when itâ€™s a manuscript file only).




## DataGate Renderer


## Open.Renderer
