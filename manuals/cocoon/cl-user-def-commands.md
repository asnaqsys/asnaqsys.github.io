title: CL User Defined Commands
---

Migrating user defined CL commands automatically poses challenges due to the staggering number of possible combinations of: unique name, possible parameters, parameter elements, and value types. To successfully migrate as many user defined commands as possible, an XML Command Definition file is provided that serves as an external table-driven template in support of this effort.

To fully use this capability, you will need to update the Command Definition File for unsupported CL or user-defined commands and then update the Location of that file into the Gallery and GamePlan directives.
