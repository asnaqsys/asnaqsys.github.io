title: ASNA - Batch Dispatch
---

Monarch provides the program `ASNA.QSys.BatchDispatch.exe` (*BatchDispatch*) to assist in the processing of jobs scheduled to run in batch. It also provides `ASNA.QSys.BatchHost.exe` (*BatchHost*).

*BatchDispatch* is a console program that ‘watches’ a job queue and creates a system process to run the program stated in the job queue entry.  The new process uses the console program *BatchHost* as the the entry point for the new job.

Read about [Batch Jobs](/manuals/programming/jobs/batch-jobs.html).

# BatchDispatch Command Line Parameters
Start a Batch processor to execute programs on a single job queue. Command line arguments are given when invoking BatchDispatch to configure it.

These are options that can be passed in the command line:
 - `q=` used to specify the Job queue name.  Argument is Required.
 - `p=` provides the Full Path to the base queues folder.  Argument is Optional, defaults to the subfolder `JobQueues` under the user's `LocalApplicationData`.
 - `x=` used to specify the Extension to the job que entry. Argument is Optional, defaults to `.jqe`.
 - `s` indicates a Silent run. Argument is Optional, defaults to `true`.

For example, the following command line

```bat
C:> C:/MOM/ASNA.QSys.BatchDispatch.exe /q=NIGHTLY -p="C:/MonarchQueues/JobQueues" 
```

will start BatchDispatch processing entries with the extension of `.jqe` found in the job queue `NIGHTLY` which is located in folder `C:/MonarchQueues/JobQueues/NIGHTLY`, BatchDispatch will not be verbose but run silentely.
