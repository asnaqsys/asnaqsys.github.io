title: Expo Client-Side Content
---

Interactive Applications include at least one .NET Website Project.

.NET Website Projects implements the [User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface) Pages of the Application.

To present a rich User Interface on a Browser, most Websites rely on `Client-Side` JavaScript and CSS libraries that are downloaded from the Application server, and are cached in the browser for optimal performance.

The Website `Server-Side` in ASNA Monarch Base Applications relies on [ASNA.QSys.Expo](reference/asna-qsys-expo/expo-tags/expo-tags-intro.md). The `Client-Side` is conveniently called [ASNA QSys Expo Web Content](https://github.com/asnaqsys/asna-qsys-expo-web-content).

>*Client-Side Library*, *Web Content* and *Client-Side Framework* are all terms used in association to `Client-Side` resources on a Website.

To simplify, in the next paragraphs, we will refer to [ASNA QSys Expo Web Content](https://github.com/asnaqsys/asna-qsys-expo-web-content) simply as the [Expo Web Content](https://github.com/asnaqsys/asna-qsys-expo-web-content).

## Delivering Expo Web Content

Web Content is frequently stored in a folder structure at the root of the Website.

Typically, .NET Websites have the following root folder structure:

```
+ wwwrooot
    - css               Application Specific CSS
    - js                Application Specific JavaScript  
    + lib
        + asna-expo     Expo Web Content
            + audio
            + css
            + js
        + (other optional third party libraries)
```

An Application `response` to a Page `request` will be generated by the Web server with a content similar to the following HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0" />
    <meta name="google" content="notranslate" />
    <title>Application title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/lib/asna-expo/css/expo.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/site.css" />
    </head>

    <body>
        
        <form id="MonarchForm" method="post">
            .
            .       <!-- Active Record formats -->
            .
        </form>


        <script type="module">
            import { Page } from '../lib/asna-expo/js/asna.js';

            Page.init({ formId: 'MonarchForm' });
        </script>

        
    </body>
</html>
```

Note how the `head` section requests two [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS): `expo.css` and `site.css`. The first one is defined as part of [Expo Web Content](https://github.com/asnaqsys/asna-qsys-expo-web-content), the second as the Application specific [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).

>The order of appearance of the `CSS` requests in the Page is important.

Note how at the end of the `body` section, there is a `script` section of type "`module`", with two lines:

```html
<script type="module">
    import { Page } from '../lib/asna-expo/js/asna.js';

    Page.init({ formId: 'MonarchForm' });
</script>
```

ASNA Monarch Base applications use [JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) to implement `Client-Side` logic. The `Page` symbol is imported from the `asna.js` script file and initialized as soon as the module(s) are loaded.

>So far the assumption is that the [Expo Web Content](https://github.com/asnaqsys/asna-qsys-expo-web-content) exists in the `wwwroot` folder structure.

### How does the [Expo Web Content](https://github.com/asnaqsys/asna-qsys-expo-web-content) get to the `wwwroot` folder structure?
