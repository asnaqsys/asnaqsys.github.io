Execution interaction between programs is achieved with the operations CALL and RETURN. At any point a program can transfer control to another program by calling it and any point the called program can return to the calling program yielding control back to it.

A program is a class that extend the Monarch Base class ASNA.QSys.Runtime.JobSupport.Program.

## CALLD
Monarch migrated programs have a global field called `_DynamicCaller` that is used throughout the class to make program calls. To call a program use the `CallD` method of the DynamicCaller class.

```cs
    _DynamicCaller.CallD("Acme.ERCAP.ORDHINQ", out _LR, ref ORDCUST);
```
The `CallD` method takes a minimum of two parameters: a string with the name of the program to call and an Indicator out-parameter which indicates whether the called program was deactivated. After these two initial parameters, ```CallD``` can take any additional parameters needed by the called program. These parameters can be passed by reference or by value.

### Multiple Versions of a Program
In the *IBMi*, programs (as well as all other objects) reside in libraries.  Two different versions of a program can have the same name as long as they are kept in different libraries.  When a program is called its location can be provided by the calling program by qualifying the name with the name of the library where it resides, i.e.: MyLibrary/MyProgram.

To differentiate among various versions of a program, the Monarch runtime relies on the proper use of **.NET namespaces** as a qualifier. For example, a program named **CUSTINQ** on the *IBMi* may become **ACME.Accounting.CUSTINQ**, while a different version of **CUSTINQ** may become **ACME.CustSvc.CUSTINQ**.  A specific version of a program can be called by providing its fully qualified name to the `CallD` method. 

### Namespace List

It is also possible to call a program by providing its unqualified name and employing some form of a list to have the system locate the proper version of the program.

In the *IBMi*, when an unqualified program is called its location gets resolved via the *Library List*. The *Library List* is a list of
libraries (directories) that the system will use to look sequentially for
a particular program or file. Each user will have her own version of the library list, and two different users calling
the same unqualified program may end up invoking different versions of the program, residing in different libraries.

In .NET, the Monarch runtime supports a similar mechanism. Calling one version or another can be controlled with the use 
of a ***Namespace List***. The namespace list is a property of the **Job** that is controlling
a particular execution instance of the application; this property is called *NamespaceList*. If an application relies on namespaces for program calls,
this list can be set up during **Job** initialization or at any time during the execution of the Job.

In the prior example, the actual `CallD` call may have only **CUSTINQ** as its parameter, and rely on setting the proper namespace in the **Job**
via `NamespaceList.Add(...)`. For example, for user *A* it may be set as `NamespaceList.Add("ACME.Accounting")`, while
for user *C* it may be set as `NamespaceList.Add("ACME.CustSvc")`. User *A* would end up calling `ACME.Accounting.CUSTINQ` and program *C* would call `ACME.CustSvc.CUSTINQ` You can add as many namespaces as you need; the Monarch runtime will try them sequentially to match the fully qualified program name (*i.e. the namespace
plus the program name*) to a class in an assembly.

But which assembly and where to find it? The answer is the [***Assembly List***](#assembly-list).

`CallD` accepts program names that may be fully qualified, qualified with only a part of the namespace or completly unqualified.  For the examples in the next sections, assume a Job's `NamespaceList` is set as follows:

 In addition to the NamespaceList provided by the user, there is an implied *empty* Namespace as the first element of the list, so the actual list looks like this:
 
 0. `String.Empty`
 1. "ACME.Accounting"
 2. "ACME.ERP"
 3. "ACME"

 This first *empty* Namespace ensures that the actual program class name passed to `CallD` is used as-is and, only if not found, then the attempt to find a qualifed name is attempte.

#### Using an unqualified name:
An unqualified `CallD` program call uses a name that contains no periods. Execution of the following line

> `CallD ("AR0004")`

would cause these names to be tried out until a program class is found with that name:
 1. AR0004
 2. ACME.Accounting.AR0004
 3. ACME.ERP.AR0004
 4. ACME.AR0004

#### Using an partially qualified name:
A partially qualified `CallD` program call uses a name that contains some periods. Execution of the following line

> `CallD ("Patch.AR0004")`

would cause these names to be tried out until a program class is found with that name:
 1. Patch.AR0004
 2. ACME.Accounting.Patch.AR0004
 3. ACME.ERP.Patch.AR0004
 4. ACME.Patch.AR0004

#### Using an fully qualified name:
It is also possible to bypass the use of the Namespace list facility all together by providing a fully qualified name to `CallD`. 
The fully qualified name has to be prefixed with two colons, this is similar to the use of `global::` in C#.
For example if a program wanted to call exactly program `ACME.ERP.AR0004`, regardless of the Namespace list, 
it would use a program call like this one:

> `CallD ("::ACME.ERP.AR0004")`

If there is no class named exactly `ACME.ERP.AR0004`, then an error would be given.


### Assembly List

The assembly list is the list of all assemblies that compose the application, it is part of the configuration settings 
of the *MonaServer* section of the website's *appsettings.json* file. This list can contain paths to individual assemblies, or paths with wildcard
[patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/file-globbing#pattern-formats) that match
mutiple assemblies. For example:

```json
  "MonaServer": {
    "HostName": "*InProcess",
    "Port": 5555,
    "TraceOption": 0,
    "JobIdleTimeout": 20,
    "AssemblyList": [
      "C:\\Acme\\Accounting\\bin\\CustomerAppLogic.dll",
      "C:\\Acme\\CustomerService\\bin\\Custom*.dll"
    ]
  }
```

Classes in assemblies can be organized in any way that is convenient as long as **each class in the application
has a unique fully qualified name**.  It is also important to ensure that an assembly is listed only once avoiding 
the scenario where an assembly is defined twice in the list by having to DLLs with different **file names** 
(e.g.: MyAsembly.dll and MyAssembly.backup.dll) but with the same **assembly name** inside (i.e.: MyAssembly).


## RETURN
The return operation is implemented as a long jump using the exception catching .NET mechanism.  When a program wants to return it simple throws the exception ```ASNA.QSys.Runtime```.

## Program Entry
Before passing control to the main user code in a program some housekeeping is required to locate the proper instance of the program in an activation group and to copy the parameters passed to the global fields where the main user code expects them.

The housekeeping tasks are delegated to the [_ENTRY and __ENTRY methods](program-entry.html).

## Optional Parameters
A program may describe some of its parameters as being optional using the Optional<> generic class.

### Defining Optional Parameters
The entry point is in the ```public static _ENTRY``` method in the program's C# class. You can see that the optional parameters are given the value of ```default``` if they are not received. ```default``` is a special constant in C# which tells the compiler to insert the proper default value for the type of the field:

Here is an example of a C# program ```OtherPgm``` that takes four parameters, the last three are optional.

```C#
public static void _ENTRY(ICaller _caller, out Indicator __inLR,
    FixedString<_7>                        MsgId,
    Optional<FixedString<Len<_1, _3, _2>>> Data    = default,
    Optional<FixedString<_10>>             MsgFile = default,
    Optional<FixedString<_10>>             Library = default)
{
    __inLR = RunProgram<Messanger>(_caller, (OtherPgm _instance) => _instance.__ENTRY(MsgId, Data, MsgFile, Library));
}
```

In the body of the static ```_ENTRY``` there is a call to the instance ```__ENTRY``` method that executes after an activation (an instance of the program) is retrieved in the QSys runtime. This instance entry method counts how many of the parameters are default, copies the values of the valid parameters to the class fields, and calls ```StarEntry```, which is the method that actually contains the converted code that was in the RPG *Entry procedure. To know if a parameter was passed, the ```Optional``` class in the QSys runtime library has a property called ```IsValid```, which will be ```false``` for the default value of any Optional.

```C#
void __ENTRY(FixedString<_7>               _MsgId,
    Optional<FixedString<Len<_1, _3, _2>>> _Data = default,
    Optional<FixedString<_10>>             _MsgFile = default,
    Optional<FixedString<_10>>             _Library = default)
{
    int cparms = 1;
    bool _cleanup = true;
    if (_Library != default && _Library.IsValid)
    {
        cparms += 1;
        Library = _Library;
    }
    if (_MsgFile != default && _MsgFile.IsValid)
    {
        cparms += 1;
        MsgFile = _MsgFile;
    ...
           try
           {
               _parms = cparms;
               StarEntry(cparms);
           }
           catch(Return)
           {
           }
```

In ```StarEntry```, ```cparms``` which is the translation of %parms will contain the correct number of parameters that were passed.

```C#
void StarEntry(int cparms)
{
    if (cparms < 2)
        Data = "";

    if (cparms < 3)
        MsgFile = "ASNAMSGF";
```

### Calling a Program with Optional Parameters
At the caller, the ```CallD``` contains only the parameter passed.

In this example, passes only one of the optional parameters () is given:
```C#
_DynamicCaller.CallD("Acme.Messenger", out _LR, "CST0005", CustNum);
```

This example passes all the parameters:
```C#
_DynamicCaller.CallD("Acme.Messenger", out _LR, "CST0012", CustNum, "CRMMSGS", "TSODAL");
```
