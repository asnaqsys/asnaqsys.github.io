title: Program Entry
---

A [Monarch Program](/concepts/architecture/monarch-programs.html) migrated from the IBM i should have the ability to be called by other programs providing similar semantics to the original call/return facilities as well as respecting the expectation of the program's instantiation in an [Activation Group](/concepts/architecture/activation-groups.html).

When a program calls another program, all it needs to know is the program's name, i.e.: the programs class name.  The calling program may even provide the name to the call facility by passing a string variable with the called program's name.

In order to pass control to the method with the main body of the called program, two C# helper methods are created to facilitate creating or finding the proper instance of the program and managing the parameter passing:
 * A static ```_ENTRY``` method and
 * An instance ```__ENTRY``` method

 The main body of the program, derived from the main C-Specs, is an instance method called StarEntry.

## Static _ENTRY Method
The static ```_ENTRY``` method is the initial target of a program call. This method is responsible for the following tasks:
 * Make local copies of parameters when these are:
    - x
    - y
 * Find the instance of the program in its Activation Group, if it does not exist, then create the instance.
 * Call the instance method ```__ENTRY```
 * If the parameters were passed to this method by reference, then copy the local copy of the parameters back to the caller's parameters.

## Instance __ENTRY Method
The instance ```__ENTRY``` method copies the parameters passed to the program to the global fields where the rest of the program expects to find them.  It also counts the actual parameters passed to the program. 

Once the parameters are accounted for and copied, the method then proceed to call the main procedure ```StarEntry``` wrapping the call in a try/catch block to enable it to process benignly the exception generated by the ```Return``` operation.

## StarEntry Method
The  main body of the program, derived from the main C-Specs, is located in an instance method named ```StarEntry```.  This method contain user code.
