ASNA MonarchÂ® is a set of technologies that assist in the migration of RPG applications to the .NET platform. While it strives to provide seamless flow of the applications objects to the new platform, there are several considerations that must be undertaken and instances where complete like-to-like transformation is not possible.

This section provides information on the level of transparency and support achieved by Monarch 11.4 for the different object types. Strategies are suggested for dealing with those issues where manual intervention is required.

Monarch will continue to evolve as market requirements change; therefore, the information provided in this document is subject to change. This information is current as of August 2023.
