In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to write and modernize code has become a game-changer. 

This technique is particularly beneficial for updating existing web applications that may have been migrated using tools that result in a user interface that, while preserving valuable and refined legacy logic, can benefit from the more effective and visually appealing components available in modern web browsers.

For seasoned developers, embracing AI can significantly enhance productivity and streamline the modernization process.

One of the most effective AI implementations for this purpose is [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). This tool assists developers by generating code snippets, suggesting improvements, and even writing entire functions based on the context provided. By using AI-driven prompts, developers can quickly transform outdated code into modern, efficient, and maintainable applications.

Writing good prompts is key to getting better outcomes with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). Just like there are techniques to help you communicate effectively with a human, there are tips to help you get better results with Copilot when writing prompts. 

To maximize the benefits of AI prompting, it is essential to craft effective prompts. For guidance on how to achieve better results with GitHub Copilot, refer to this comprehensive Microsoft article: [Get better results with Copilot prompting](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/get-better-results-with-copilot-prompting-77251d6c-e162-479d-b398-9e46cf73da55).

In the following topics we present specific use cases, where effective AI prompting may be used to achieve Monarch migrated Application modernization.

>The advantage of using AI prompts with your code, compared to copy/pasting code recipes (as is traditional when presenting code examples in product documentation), is that AI can tailor the generated code **to your specific context**. This approach increases the likelihood that the new code will work seamlessly with your existing codebase, which may differ significantly from the examples provided in online guides.
