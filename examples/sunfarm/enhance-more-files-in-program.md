## Overview

Sometimes a program requires reading from additional database files to collect more data that we want to present to the user.

On the Sales/Returns Page, instead of showing in the Chart **totals** for Sales and Returns for a given Customer, we would like to show a year's full of information with monthly data (the last year registered). The new chart is useful to show performance trends.
