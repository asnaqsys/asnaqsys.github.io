## Overview

[App Branding](https://www.asynclabs.co/blog/digital-design/what-is-a-brand-app-and-why-your-business-needs-it/) is the process of creating the personality of a product. App branding is how users perceive the app, its reputation, communication, and visual image.

The simplest Branding is to present an image in the Page heading on **ALL* pages.

As we [described](examples/sunfarm/sunfarm.md) we are assuming the name of the Modernized App is "Sunfarm".

Let's proceed to add a Logo to the App in a shared place where it can be used by All Pages.

## Application Logo Branding

This is what we want to see at the top of any of our App pages:

![Desired Logo rendering](./images/logo-heading-as-rendered.png)

As simple as it may seem, this presents some challenges:

1. We want the graphics (sun and foliage) to blend-in with green background (no border on image).
2. The name "sunfarm" should be rendered without distortion (high quality) on any device.
3. The company "motto" (always fresh) should have some transparency to reduce the importance. Also rendered without distortion (high quality) on any device.
