## Remarks

**DeleteAllRecords** marks all undeleted records in the file as being deleted.

The file should be opened with the [ AccessMode](file-adapter-class-access-mode-property.html) property set to a value including the [ AccessMode.Delete](access-mode-enumeration.html) flag in order to permit delete access to the file.
## Examples


```cs 
  /* We open the file in order to delete all of its records. */
  AdgConnection db = new AdgConnection("*Public/DG NET Local");
  FileAdapter dbFile = new FileAdapter(db, "*Libl/CMASTNEW", "CMMASTER");
  dbFile.AccessMode = AccessMode.Delete;
  /* Its generally good practice to make sure you have an exclusive lock
   * on a file that you are deleting all of the records from, but some
   * databases do not require it. */
  dbFile.OpenAttributes.ShareTypes = ShareTypes.Exclusive;
  AdgDataSet myDS = null;

  try
  {
      dbFile.Open(myDS);
  }
  catch(dgException dgEx)
  {
      db.Close();
      if (dgEx.Error == dgErrorNumber.dgEmBUSYOBJ)
      {
          MessageBox.Show("Couldn't open the file for exclusive access.", "Error opening file.");
          //Exit routine or procedure here to avoid preceding file operations.
      }
      else 
          throw dgEx;
  }
  dbFile.DeleteAllRecords();
