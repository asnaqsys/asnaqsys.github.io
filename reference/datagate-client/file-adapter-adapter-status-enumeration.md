title: FileAdapter.AdapterStatus Enumeration

---

Indicates the status of the file: open or closed. 

```cs
 public FileAdapter.AdapterStatus Status { get: }
```

## Remarks

The **FileAdapter.AdapterStatus** enumeration is used as a parameter by the [ FileAdapter.Status Property](file-adapter-class-status-property.html) of the [FileAdapter Class](file-adapter-class.html).
## Members



| Member | Description | Value |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Open | The file is open. | 1 |
| Closed | The file is closed. | 0 |



## Examples

Here we want to use a **FileAdapter** object named "dbFile" but are unsure as to whether or not it's been initialized, so we check for null and use the Status property to make sure it's opened and open it if it isn't.
<pre>        <span class="lang">
 [C#] 
        </span>
  if (dbFile == null)
      dbFile = new FileAdapter();
  if (dbFile.Status == FileAdapter.AdapterStatus.Closed)
  {
      dbFile.Connection = myAdgConnection;
      dbFile.FileName = fileName;
      dbFile.MemberName = memberName;
      dbFile.OpenNewAdgDataSet(out myDataSet);
  }
  </pre>
