## Remarks

The `ASNA.QSys.Runtime` assembly contains a collection of classes that are integral to the operation of the ASNA QSys system. These classes provide a range of functionalities, from handling arrays and built-in functions according to RPG semantics, to managing database connections and performing operations on data files.

The classes in this assembly are designed to work together to provide a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with the ASNA QSys system. They encapsulate complex operations into easy-to-use methods, making it easier for developers to build robust and efficient applications.

Here are some key points to remember when working with these classes:

- **Interoperability**: These classes are designed to work seamlessly with each other, providing a consistent and predictable interface for developers.
- **RPG Semantics**: Many of these classes provide methods that follow RPG programming patterns, making it easier for developers familiar with RPG to use them.
- **Exception Handling**: Several classes are dedicated to handling exceptions, providing detailed error information that can help with debugging and error handling.
- **Database Operations**: There are classes that manage database connections and perform operations on data files, abstracting the complexities of these tasks away from the developer.

Remember to refer to the individual class documentation for specific details about each class's behavior, usage, and special considerations.
