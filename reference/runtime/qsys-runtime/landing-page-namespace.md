## Remarks

The `ASNA.QSys.Runtime` namespace is a core part of the ASNA QSys system. It contains classes, interfaces, enumerations, and structures that provide the fundamental functionalities of the system. This namespace is designed to provide a comprehensive set of tools for building, running, and managing ASNA applications.

Some of the key features provided by this namespace include:

- Runtime support for ASNA applications, including data management, error handling, and system utilities.
- Interfaces for interacting with various parts of the ASNA system, such as the database, user interface, and system services.
- Enumerations that define the constants used throughout the ASNA system.
- Structures that encapsulate small groups of related variables, providing a convenient way to group related data.

This namespace is the parent topic in the Table of Contents, and it includes pages that describe the classes, interfaces, enumerations, and structures defined within it. Each of these pages provides detailed information about the usage, properties, methods, and events of each item.

Developers working with the ASNA QSys system should familiarize themselves with the contents of this namespace, as it forms the basis for most ASNA development tasks.
