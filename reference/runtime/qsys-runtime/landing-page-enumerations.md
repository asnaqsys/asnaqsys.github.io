## Remarks

The `ASNA.QSys.Runtime` assembly contains a collection of enumerations that are used throughout the ASNA QSys system. These enumerations provide a set of predefined constants that make the code more readable and less prone to errors.

These enumerations cover a wide range of functionalities, from defining the valid values for date/time fixed types, specifying the type of Cycle routine to call, to describing the flag that records the status of a workstation dataset as it is processed.

Here are some key points to remember when working with these enumerations:

- **Readability**: Using these enumerations makes your code more readable, as they provide meaningful names for a set of related values.
- **Error Prevention**: By using enumerations, you can reduce the likelihood of errors caused by passing in invalid values.
- **Consistency**: These enumerations provide a consistent way to handle sets of related values across your application.

Remember to refer to the individual enumeration documentation for specific details about each enumeration's values and usage.
