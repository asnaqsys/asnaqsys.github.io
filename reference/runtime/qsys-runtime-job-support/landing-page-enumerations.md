title: ASNA.QSys.Runtime.JobSupport Enumerations
---

## Remarks

The `ASNA.QSys.Runtime.JobSupport` namespace contains enumerations that are used throughout the ASNA QSys system. These enumerations define a type for variables that can hold a set of named constants, providing a way to encapsulate and organize related constants in a type-safe manner.

These enumerations cover a wide range of functionalities, from specifying the type of a DLO document, to describing the execution status of a job, to defining the filter level of which messages should be logged, among others.

Here are some key points to remember when working with these enumerations:

- **Type Safety**: Enumerations provide a type-safe way to work with sets of related constants. This can help prevent bugs by ensuring that only valid values are used.
- **Readability**: Enumerations can make your code more readable by replacing magic numbers or strings with meaningful names.
- **Organization**: Enumerations provide a way to group related constants together, making your code more organized and easier to maintain.

Remember to refer to the individual enumeration documentation for specific details about each enumeration's values and usage.
