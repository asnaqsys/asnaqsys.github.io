## Remarks

Website Applications using `ASNA.QSys.Expo` assembly, typically have a configuration file at the root folder of the site named: `appsettings.json`.

The configuration file `appsettings.json` uses [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) file format.

There is a `"MonaServer"` object defined in the schema for `appsettings.json`, where the Properties described by this class can be set to configure [MonaServer](the Application Server).
