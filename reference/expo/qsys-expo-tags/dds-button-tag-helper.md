## Remarks

Interactive IBM i Legacy Applications present data to the user on the screen then allow the user to enter additional data and press Enter, or a Function Key, to continue the execution of the application. As part of the information sent from the screen to the application, the location of the cursor (row,column) and the Function Key pressed is included.

Expo applications function the same way, allowing users to use their keyboards to enter data and press function keys on their keyboards. The DdsButton provides an alternate way for the user to select the function key desired.  The DdsButton also allows the programmer to simulate the location of the cursor when the DdsButton is pressed along with the name of then input field and even provide some data on the field when the DdsButton is clicked.

An attention identifier (AID) is the way of specifying the function key used by a user. To set the name of the function key being impersonated by the DdsButton use the property `AidKey`. 

A programmer enables which function keys are available to the user by listing the keys in the Model at the File level, using the [DisplayPage](/reference/expo/qsys-expo-model/display-page-attribute.html) attribute, or at the record level utilizing the [Record](/reference/expo/qsys-expo-model/record-attribute.html) attribute, in both cases the attribute's `FunctionKeys` property is used.  If the key is to be enable only sometimes then an indicator expression can be provided.

In order for the DdsButton to be rendered and available on the screen, the corresponding function key which it impersonates should be enabled by the application.  For instance, if the programmer adds a DdsButton with its `AidKey` set to `F4`, then the function key `F4` should be enabled by the application at either the File or the Record level.

### Simulating Cursor Position

Some legacy applications used a technique where the user was able to position the `cursor` on an input-capable field and press one of the available `Function Keys` to submit the Page. Application logic would identify the pressed `Function Key` combined with the location of the cursor (next to a named field), and determine the action to take.

Modernized Applications may want to provide additional [HTML Button](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/button) elements in strategic places on the Page, to improve usability.

#### Reporting a Field Name
To maintain the Legacy Application logic intact, `DdsButton` Tag Helper can simulate the action of navigating to the desired input element and *pressing* a specified [AidKey](/reference/expo/qsys-expo-model/aid-key.html).

For example, assuming that a Display Page has a *Prompt* feature, indicated with `F4` valid for fields `SFSTATE` and `SFSTATUS` (record `CUSTREC`), the following two `DdsButtons` may be added to improve usability:

```html
<DdsRecord For="CUSTREC" KeyNames="ENTER 'Submit'; F3 'Exit'; F4 'Prompt'; F6 'New Customer'; F11 'Remove Customer'; F12 'Back';">
    <div Row="2">
        . . .
        <DdsButton Col="91" ButtonStyle="Icon" IconId="search" AidKey="F4" FocusField="CUSTREC.SFSTATUS" IconTitle="Prompt for Status Codes" />
    </div>

    <div Row="7">
        . . .
        <DdsButton Col="40" ButtonStyle="Icon" IconId="search" AidKey="F4" FocusField="CUSTREC.SFSTATE" IconTitle="Prompt for State Codes" />
    </div>

<DdsRecord/>
```

The first `DdsButton` will appear on `Row 2`, `Col 91` and when user clicks (or Taps with finger) on this button, it simulates that the `cursor` was located on field "CUSTREC.SFSTATUS" and the press of the `F4`[AidKey](/reference/expo/qsys-expo-model/aid-key.html)

The second `DdsButton` will appear on `Row 7`, `Col 40` and when user clicks (or Taps with finger) on this button, it simulates that the `cursor` was located on field "CUSTREC.SFSTATE" and the press of the `F4`[AidKey](/reference/expo/qsys-expo-model/aid-key.html)

Both `DdsButton` appear as icons with the shape of a magnifying glass (typically used by *search*).

>Note: The Application Logic remains intact. 

#### Reporting a Row and Column Position
If the application is looking for the Row and Column where the cursor was positioned at the time the function key was pressed, then the programmer can use the `VirtualRowCol` property of DdsButton to simulate that position. 

```html
    <DdsButton Col="40" ButtonStyle="Icon" IconId="search" AidKey="F4" VirtualRowCol="7,27" IconTitle="Prompt for State Codes" />
```

### Setting a Value

In addition to having the DdsButton simulate the position of the cursor in a particular field, it is also possible to specify some value to be entered for the selected field. 

The following example shows an input capable field named VZCFCD used by the application to receive some confirmation.  The two DdsButtons allow the user to simply click them to express her intention. Clicking  the `Confirm` button will enter a 'Y' on the field `VZCFCD` of record format `RCONFIRM` and press \<Enter\>. Clicking on the `Cancel` button will simulate pressing the \<F12\> key.

```html
<DdsRecord For="RCONFIRM" KeyNames="ENTER 'Intro.'; F12 'Cancel';" WindowLeftCol="50" WindowTopRow="22" WindowHeightRows="1" WindowWidthCols="38">
    . . .
    <DdsCharField Col="12" For="RCONFIRM.VZCFCD"  VirtualRowCol="24,73" Color="Blue" />
    <DdsButton Col="24" AidKey="Enter" ButtonStyle="Button" Text="Confirm" FocusField="RCONFIRM.VZCFCD" FieldValue="Y" />
    <DdsButton Col="32" AidKey="F12"   ButtonStyle="Button" Text="Cancel" />
    . . . 
<DdsRecord/>
```

### Focusing on a Subfile's Field
To set a DdsButton's `FocusField` property to a subfile field use this syntax:

```html
<DdsSubfileRecord RecordNumber="rrn" For="SFLC.SFL1">
    . . .
    <DdsButton Col="7"  FocusField=@($"SFLC.SFL1[{rrn}].SFSEL") FieldValue="2" AidKey="Enter" Title="Update Customer" ButtonStyle="Link"   Text="Update" />
    <DdsButton Col="14" FocusField=@($"SFLC.SFL1[{rrn}].SFSEL") FieldValue="3" AidKey="Enter" Title="Display Sales"   ButtonStyle="Button" Text="Sales" />
</DdsSubfileRecord>
```


### Button Styles
The DdsButton can be rendered in one of four [styles](/reference/expo/qsys-expo-tags/button-styles.html):
 + Button
 + Icon
 + Image
 + Link

#### Button
To display the DdsButton as a link, set the `ButtonStyle="Button"` and the `Text` property to name the button.

```html
    <DdsButton Col="24" AidKey="Enter" ButtonStyle="Button" Text="Confirm" FocusField="RCONFIRM.VZCFCD" FieldValue="Y" />
    <DdsButton Col="32" AidKey="F12"   ButtonStyle="Button" Text="Cancel" />
```
![](images/dds-button-button.jpg)

#### Icon

When displaying a DdsButton as an Icon, use one of the shapes provided by the library. The [*Icon Shapes*](/reference/expo/non-generated-reference/dds-button-icon-reference.html) are simple and clean, monochrome (color can be changed to any solid color), scaled without loss and respect the background (use *transparent* background).

To display the DdsButton as a link, set the `ButtonStyle="Button"` and set the name of the Icon to be used on the `IconID` property.

```html
    <DdsButton Col="24" AidKey="Enter" ButtonStyle="Icon" IconId="check"         Color="green" FocusField="RCONFIRM.VZCFCD" FieldValue="Y" />
    <DdsButton Col="32" AidKey="F12"   ButtonStyle="Icon" IconId="remove-circle" Color="red />
```

#### Image

To display the DdsButton as an image, set the `ButtonStyle="Image"` and set the `Image` property to the URL of the desired image.

```html
    <DdsButton Col="24" AidKey="Enter" ButtonStyle="Image" Image="/images/confirm.jpg" FocusField="RCONFIRM.VZCFCD" FieldValue="Y" />
    <DdsButton Col="36" AidKey="F12"   ButtonStyle="Image" Image="/images/cancel.jpg" />
```
![](images/dds-button-image.jpg)


#### Link
To display the DdsButton as a link, set the `ButtonStyle="Link"` and the `Text` property to name the link.

```html
    <DdsButton Col="24" AidKey="Enter" ButtonStyle="Link" Text="Confirm" FocusField="RCONFIRM.VZCFCD" FieldValue="Y" />
    <DdsButton Col="32" AidKey="F12"   ButtonStyle="Link" Text="Cancel" />
```
