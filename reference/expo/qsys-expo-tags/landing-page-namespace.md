## Remarks

The `ASNA.QSys.Expo.Tags` namespace is a crucial part of the ASNA QSys system. It contains a collection of classes, interfaces, enumerations, and structures that provide the fundamental functionalities for handling and managing tags in ASNA applications.

These functionalities include but are not limited to:

- Defining and manipulating various types of tags used in the system
- Providing interfaces for consistent implementation of tag-related operations
- Enumerations that define the constants used for various types of tags
- Structures that encapsulate small groups of related variables, providing a convenient way to group related data

This namespace is the parent topic in the Table of Contents, and it includes pages that describe the items defined within it. Each of these pages provides detailed information about the usage, properties, methods, and events of each item.

Developers working with the ASNA QSys system should familiarize themselves with the contents of this namespace, as it forms the basis for most ASNA development tasks related to tag management.
