title: EditCodes Enumeration
---

Defines the equivalent code-names for the supported [IBM i Edit Codes](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.2?topic=codes-summary-edit)

**Namespace:** ASNA.QSys.Expo.Model <br/>
**Assembly:** ASNA.QSys.Expo.Model

## Remarks

C# Syntax for Enumerations provides a descriptive naming, such that when referencing a member, the name of the enumeration is included in the syntax.

For example, to refer to Edit Code "D", you would enter:

```cs
EditCodes.D
```
Notes: 
1. The `enum` member does not need the word `EditCode`, that is, to avoid duplication, like EditCodes.EditCode_D (or something like it).
2. C# names do not allow the first letter to be a numeric value, then for Edit Code '3', the named is spelled out as EditCodes.Three.
