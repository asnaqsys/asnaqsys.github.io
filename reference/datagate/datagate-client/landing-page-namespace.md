## Remarks

Contains the classes, enumerations e interfaces proivided by **ASNA DataGateClient** namespace for accessing database server resources.


## Exceptions
The class library documentation lists the exceptions that each member throws along with a description of the condition under which it is thrown. 

## Thread Safety
All public static members (methods, properties, fields, and events) within the DataGate Client support concurrent access within a multithreaded environment. Therefore, any DataGate Client static member can be simultaneously invoked from two threads without encountering race conditions, deadlocks, or crashes.

For all classes and structures in DataGate Client, check the Thread Safety section in the Reference documentation to determine whether it is thread safe. If you want to use a class that is not thread-safe in a multithreaded environment you must wrap an instance of the class with code that supplies the necessary synchronization constructs.
