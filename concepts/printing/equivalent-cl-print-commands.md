### Job Properties Related to Printing

The `Monarch.Job` class has two properties pertaining to printing:

- `OutputQueuesRoot` – Specifies the root folder where the Output Queues are located in the system.
- `OutputQueue` – This property specifies the queue where the spooled file will be created for all printer files unless there is an outstanding OVRPRTF for a printer file directing the spooled file to a different queue via the OUTQ parameter.

The Change Job command allows setting of the OutputQueue property.

| **Command** | **Keywords** | **Implementation** | **Purpose** |

| CHGJOB | JOB('\*')<br/>OUTQ | `Job.OutputQueue` | **Change Job** <br />The OUTQ keyword specifies the output queue used for spooled files by setting the Monarch.Job's OutputQueue property. |
