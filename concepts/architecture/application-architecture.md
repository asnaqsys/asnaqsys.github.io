## Jobs
IBM i programs rely on a runtime environment provided in the form of a Job. Jobs on the IBM i represent a schedulable unit of work.
They are similar to a process in Windows, Unix and other operating systems, however, Jobs are typically much 'heavier' than processes.

Some of the facilities provided to programs by the Job are:
- Program Call Stack (Invocations)
- Program Instantiation in Activation Groups (Activations)
- Library Lists
- File Overrides
- Local Data Area

After the Job has been established, control is passed to the initial program which in turn get the application going.

IBM i Jobs can generally be classified as being either batch or interactive, where interactive jobs are associated with a workstation. Typical RPG application jobs are started in one of three ways on the IBM i:
1.	A batch job request is submitted by a program running in an existing job or by a user from a command line. When the  request is processed, the batch job is created.
2.	A batch job request is submitted by an automatic job scheduler. When the  request is processed, the batch job is created.
3.	An interactive job is created when a user signs on to a workstation.

### Monarch Jobs
Monarch provides an execution context anchored around the concept of a Job and implemented in its class library. Similar to IBM i Jobs, Monarch Jobs are classified as batch or interactive. 
Monarch Interactive jobs consist of one or more class libraries and are executed in a dedicated thread, colloquially known as _blue_ threads, of a Monarch Application Server process; these Interactive jobs are associated with an ASP.NET Session.
Monarch Batch jobs can be run in their own process or on a dedicated thread alongside the thread of the job that started it. 

Some of the facilities provided to programs by the Monarch Job are:
- Program Call Stack (Invocations)
- Program Instantiation in Activation Groups (Activations)
- A permanent connection to the database
- [Namespace Lists](/manuals/programming/programs-and-procedures/call-program.html#CALLD)
- File Overrides
- Local Data Area

Monarch Jobs can be started in one of three ways:
1.	A new batch immediate job is created by a program running in an existing job.
2.	A batch job request is submitted to a queue and then the job is created by a job dispatcher.
3.	An interactive job is created when a new ASP.NET Session is started.

## Application Architectures
When looking at a Monarch application's architecture the first thing to note is the type of job that will be needed to run the application. Batch Jobs have a simpler architecture as they do not need to deal with user input whereas Interactive Jobs are associated with a web site user session.

For this discussion, the database server is assumed to be running on its own server, however, it is entirely possible to run it on any of the application or web servers.

### Batch Job Architecture
[Batch jobs](/manuals/programming/jobs/batch-jobs.html) execute in their own .NET Process as console programs or in a dedicated thread alongside the the thread of the job that started it.

### Interactive Job Architecture
As mentioned earlier, a set of interactive programs is packaged as a  class library derived from the CL and RPG programs and an Area in a website with the set of Razor Pages representing the programs' screens.

#### Monarch Application Server
The Monarch Application Server (MAS) is an execution environment that provides the facilities to host interactive Monarch Jobs and enables their interaction with the website hosting the Razor Pages serving as their user interface.

The core of the MAS is contained in the assembly ASNA.QSys.MonaServer.dll.  MonaServer can be configured to be instantiated within the website's ASP.NET process itself or it can be run as a separate process hosted by the (executable) service ASNA.QSys.MonaLisa (.exe).

The MAS facilities can be configured to run the application in one of these three ways:
- In-Process & In-Server
- Out-of-Process & In-Server
- Out-of-Process & Out-of-Server

Communication between the Interactive Job hosted in the MAS and the website is done via TCP/IP Sockets. 

The appsettings.json file contains a section dedicated to the Monarch Application Server.  This section, called _MonaLisaServer_, contains these two parameters:
- HostName
- Port

The HostName is the name or IP address of the machine running the MAS.
The Port indicates where the MAS listens to the website requests.
Whenever the website has to communicate with the MAS, the HostName and Port values are used to establish a connection for the transaction, typically in response to a web browser GET or POST request.

#### In-Process
In its simplest configuration, the migrated code along with the website can be run in a single process.

_MAS running in process on the Web Server_

The special value ***InProcess** as a HostName signals the website startup process to start 
an in-process instance of MonaServer.

#### Out-of-Process
It is possible to separate the Business Logic Program execution into one or more process.  Under this configuration, the website will expect the MAS to be already running and will contact it using the configured Port and Server values.

The MAS can execute directly on the web server as shown next. Use ***LoopBack** as the HostName value
to tell the website that the MAS is running in a separate process in the same machine.

Finally, the application can be run on one or more servers, separating the Business Logic Programs into one or more application servers as shown next. HostName must
be either a name to be resolved via DNS, or directly an IP address.

## Base Assemblies
Migrated Class Libraries and Executables as well as the Websites containing the Migrated Razor Pages Areas have a dependency on class libraries known as the ASNA Monarch Base (Base).

Here is the [Reference](/reference/reference-overview.html) documentation on the Base framework classes and their members.

The ASNA Monarch Base consists of the following assemblies:
- ASNA.DataGate.Client.dll
- ASNA.QSys.Runtime.dll
- ASNA.QSys.Expo.Model.dll
- ASNA.QSys.Expo.Tags.dll
- ASNA.QSys.MonaServer.dll
- ASNA.QSys.MonaLisa.exe

### Dependencies on the Base
Assemblies migrated from Programs, regardless of being Interactive or Batch, depend on:
- ASNA.DataGate.Client.dll
- ASNA.QSys.Runtime.dll

The Websites hosting the Razor Pages Areas depend on:
- ASNA.QSys.Expo.Model.dll
- ASNA.QSys.Expo.Tags.dll

If the Monarch Application Server is to be run In-Process within the Website, then the site will also depend on this assemblies:
- ASNA.DataGate.Client.dll
- ASNA.QSys.Runtime.dll
- ASNA.QSys.MonaServer.dll

The Out-Of-Process host ASNA.QSys.MonaLisa.exe also depends on:
- ASNA.DataGate.Client.dll
- ASNA.QSys.Runtime.dll
- ASNA.QSys.MonaServer.dll

## NuGet Packages
To facilitate the building of migrated applications, Monarch Base is made available via the following NuGet packages:

- **ASNA.DataGate.Client package**
  - ASNA.DataGate.Client.dll

- **ASNA.QSys.Runtime package**
  - ASNA.DataGate.Client package
  - ASNA.QSys.Runtime.dll

- **ASNA.QSys.MonaServer package**
  - ASNA.QSys.Runtime package
  - ASNA.QSys.MonaServer.dll

- **ASNA.QSys.Expo package**
  - ASNA.QSys.Expo.Model.dll
  - ASNA.QSys.Expo.Tags.dll

The NuGet packages are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/asnaqsys/packages)
