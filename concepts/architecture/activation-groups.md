title: Activation Groups
---

An Activation Group is a substructure of a Job that serves to control the state of groups of programs. The Activation Group keeps a reference for each program that belongs to it.

Before a program is given execution control, the programâ€™s activation instance has to be found or created; if an adequate activation exists in the Job it is used, otherwise, the program must be activated first.

When a program is activated, its variables are allocated in memory and some  other one-time initialization code may run. Related program are activated in activation groups. Activation groups associate the state of related programs.

When a program ends execution and before returning to the caller, the program may be deactivated depending on how the program ended and the characteristics of its activation group.

## Program Activation
When a program is called for the first time an instances to the program's class has to be created. A subsequent call to the program may reuse the program's instance or it may create a new instance for that call.

Programs and Service programs are marked with an attribute that specify the activation group where they belong and their behavior. There are three general possibilities for this attribute. A program may be marked with an activation group attribute to:
  * Be associated with a particular named activation group (```ActivationGroup("name")```).
  * Have a brand new activation group created and be associated with it (```NewActivationGroup```).
  * Associate with the activation group of the program that called it (```CallerActivationGroup```).

## Activation Group Creation
Named Activation groups are created when the first program that belongs to it gets activated. 

Programs marked with the ```NewActivationGroup``` are called, an activation group is created with a system generated name. As described below, the activation group will be destroyed when the program returns to its caller.

When a Job starts, it creates an activation group named <b>"*DEFAULT"</b> that is used by default by programs which are not marked with an activation group attribute, typically OPM programs.

## Program Deactivation
A program gets *deactivated* or disposed when its Activation Group is deleted.

## Ending an Activation Group
There are three ways for an Activation Group to be deleted:
  * After a program marked with the ```NewActivationGroup``` completes its execution and is about to return to the calling program.
  * Named activations groups can be deleted by calling the method ```JobServices.RemoveActivationGroup```.
  * When a the job reaches its natural end, it 
  
When a programs gets deactivated, its Dispose method gets called. The  implementation of the Dispose of the base class calls Dispose on each of the Modules in the program's module collection.
