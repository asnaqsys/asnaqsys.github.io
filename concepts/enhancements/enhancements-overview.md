Once a Legacy Application has been migrated and tested, the next step is to improve it.

There are several ways to enhance a Migrated Application:

- Improving the *Look and Feel*
- Improve Navigation
- Adding new functionality

## Improving the *Look and Feel*

The best way to present techniques that may be applied to a Legacy Migrated Application, is by showing how the Original Migration looked *Before* and how it can look *After*.

For that purpose, we have written a detailed [Examples](/examples/sunfarm/sunfarm.html) showing how to perform basic Enhancements.

## Improve Navigation

Web Browser implementations exists today in a variety of devices, all the way from large hi-resolution computer Displays, to large Tablets and even Mobile Phones.

These devices offer several different ways to interact with the Application, from the simple mouse input device to sophisticated touch devices.

Just the hi-resolution *Surface* on any of the above mentioned devices, makes it possible to include a lot more data into one Page - compared to the small 5250 Terminal -. It is possible to reduce the number to Screens by combining several into one. 

Better visual representations, such as *Buttons*, *Checkboxes*, *Radio Groups*, *Drop down lists*, clickable *Icons*. The possibilities of Web-based Applications are almost limitless.

Explore the [10 Basic UI Enhancements](/examples/sunfarm/sunfarm.html) and [Basic Logic Enhancements](/examples/sunfarm/sunfarm-logic-change.html) to get this process started.
