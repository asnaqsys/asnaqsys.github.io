title: Legacy Application Background
---

In the context of ASNA Monarch Base, **Legacy Applications**  are those that:

1. Are *existing* Applications that Withstood the test of time.
2. Are *crucial* to existing Business processes.
3. Were *designed* for the [IBM i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i)
4. Are *migrated* to run on [Microsoft ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-5.0)

In order to work with Legacy Migrated Applications, it is very important to understand how Applications were designed and deployed in the original platform.

There are important concepts and peculiarities about how IBM i Applications execute, which **do not have** an equivalent on Microsoft ASP.NET Core, motivation for [ASNA](https://asna.com) to write the [ASNA Monarch Base framework](https://asnaqsys.github.io/), making it possible for Legacy Applications to efficiently run in the new environment.
