title: Legacy Application Background
---

<br>

**Legacy Applications** in the context of ASNA Monarch are those that are:

1. Existing Applications that Withstood the test of time.
2. Are crucial to existing Business process.
3. Were Designed for the [IBM i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_i)
4. Are Migrated to run on [Microsoft ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-5.0)

In order to work with Legacy Migrated Applications, it is vey important to understand how Applications were designed and deployed in the original platform.

There are important concepts and peculiarities about how IBM i Applications execute, which **do not have** an equivalent in Microsoft ASP.NET Core, motivation for [ASNA](https://asna.com) to write [ASNA Monarch Core Framework](https://asnaqsys.github.io/), making it possible for Legacy Applications to efficiently run in the new environment.
